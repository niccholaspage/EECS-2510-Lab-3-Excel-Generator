/**
 * Main.kt - Lab 3 Excel Generator
 *
 * This program runs the comparison program written in C++ for Lab 3. It does so by launching
 * the comparison program on files passed in as parameters multiple times, averaging out the results
 * from the program (parsed through the console output of the program) and writing them directly into
 * an Excel workbook. This program utilizes the Kotlin standard library as well as Apache POI and Apache
 * POI OOXML, allowing it to create and manipulate Excel workbooks.
 *
 * Kotlin and Apache POI were picked due to my experience with the language and dependency through one of
 * my jobs. Kotlin greatly cuts down the verbosity seen in Java and in my opinion, is actually fun to write.
 * Apache POI is a very helpful library and makes creating and editing Excel workbooks straightforward and easy.
